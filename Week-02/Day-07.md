# Day 07 – 26 Jan 2026
## 🟢 AI-Based Food Recognition System

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the food recognition problem and identify suitable datasets
for building a large-scale food classification system.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Defined the problem of food recognition for mobile and real-world application use cases.
- Identified challenges related to visually similar food categories.
- Researched and shortlisted multiple open-source food image datasets.
- Analyzed dataset coverage across cuisines and food types.

## 📊 Dataset Sources Used

### 1️⃣ Food-101 Dataset
**Source:** Official Food-101 dataset  
**Description:**  
Contains 101 western food categories such as pizza, burger, pasta, desserts, etc.  
**Usage:**  
Used as the primary benchmark dataset for training and validating the food classification model.

### 2️⃣ Indian Food Images Dataset
**Source:** Open-source Indian food repositories (Kaggle / GitHub)  
**Description:**  
Includes Indian dishes such as biryani, dosa, idli, paneer-based dishes, sweets, and snacks.  
**Usage:**  
Integrated to ensure regional cuisine coverage beyond western datasets.

### 3️⃣ Fruits & Vegetables Dataset
**Source:** Public fruits and vegetables datasets (Kaggle)  
**Description:**  
Includes apples, bananas, carrots, tomatoes, and other produce.  
**Usage:**  
Added to improve dataset diversity and support healthy food recognition.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Inconsistent class naming across datasets
- Large variation in image quality
- Presence of duplicate and corrupted images

## 🧠 Learnings
Selecting diverse and high-quality datasets is critical for building robust
food recognition systems.
