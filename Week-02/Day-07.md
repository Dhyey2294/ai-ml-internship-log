## 🟢 AI-Based Food Recognition System

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the food recognition problem and prepare a diverse dataset suitable
for large-scale image classification.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Defined the food recognition problem for mobile application use cases.
- Identified challenges related to visually similar food categories.
- Collected large-scale food image datasets covering:
  - Indian cuisine
  - Western food items
  - Fruits and vegetables
- Analyzed dataset diversity and class overlap.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Variations in image quality across datasets
- Inconsistent class naming conventions
- Presence of corrupted and duplicate images

## 🧠 Learnings
Understanding dataset quality and diversity is critical before starting model training.
