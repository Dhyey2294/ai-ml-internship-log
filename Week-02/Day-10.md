# Day 10 – 29 Jan 2026
## 🟣 Model Inference & Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate the trained model on various image sources and analyze prediction behavior.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Performed inference using the trained YOLOv8 classification model.
- Tested the model on:
  - Validation dataset
  - Unseen raw dataset images
  - External internet images
- Analyzed prediction confidence scores and class rankings.
- Evaluated model behavior on visually similar food items.

## ✅ Outcome
The model demonstrated reliable predictions and acceptable inference speed
for real-time applications.

## 🧠 Learnings
Inference testing on unseen data is essential to understand real-world performance.
