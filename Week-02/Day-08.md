# Day 08 – 27 Jan 2026
## 🟡 Dataset Cleaning & Preparation

## 🎯 Objective
To clean, standardize, and merge multiple datasets into a unified structure
for large-scale food classification.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Removed corrupted and unreadable images.
- Standardized class names across all datasets.
- Identified and removed duplicate images.
- Merged datasets into a single unified directory structure.
- Created a multi-class dataset with 200+ food categories.
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

## ✅ Outcome
A clean and well-structured dataset suitable for training deep learning
classification models.

## 🧠 Learnings
Proper dataset preprocessing significantly improves training stability
and final model performance.
