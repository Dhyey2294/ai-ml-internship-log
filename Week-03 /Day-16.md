# Day 16 – 05 Feb 2026
## 🟣 Detection to Classification Pipeline Design

## 🎯 Objective
To design an automated pipeline that merges detection
and classification into a unified inference system.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Planned workflow:

  Input Image  
  → Detection  
  → Crop  
  → Classification  
  → Structured Output

- Defined requirements:
  - No manual intervention
  - Real-time capable
  - Scalable
  - Clean integration

- Designed automatic bounding box extraction.
- Determined how cropped outputs will be forwarded
  directly to the classifier.
- Structured final output format to include:
  - Food name
  - Confidence
  - Bounding box
    
## ✅ Outcome
- Clear pipeline architecture finalized.
- Ready for implementation.

## 🧠 Learnings
System integration is as important as model accuracy.
