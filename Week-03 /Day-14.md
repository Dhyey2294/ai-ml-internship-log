# Day 14 – 03 Feb 2026
## 🟢 Food Detection System – Setup & Understanding

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the architecture of an end-to-end food detection and
recognition system and prepare the dataset and training pipeline.

## 🔹 Work Done
- Defined system goal:
  - Detect multiple food items in an image
  - Extract each detected region
  - Classify items automatically
  - Return structured predictions

- Studied YOLOv8 detection workflow.
- Explored Roboflow dataset:
  - Workspace: ahmad-nabil
  - Dataset: food-detection-for-yolo-training
  - Format: YOLOv8

- Reviewed dataset structure:
  train / valid / test splits with images and labels.

- Identified 12 detection classes:
  cake, chicken curry, croissant, french fries, fried chicken,
  fried rice, hamburger, noodles, pasta, pizza, sandwich, sushi.

## ✅ Outcome
- Complete clarity on detection + classification integration.
- Dataset and training environment ready.

## 🧠 Learnings
Understanding system design before implementation
reduces future integration errors.
